&lt;p>Pros:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s FAST (fewer than 10 seconds in GitHub Actions to build!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Great multilanguage support, without writing any weird template or JavaScript in Jekyll.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Cons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I cannot customize my theme conveniently as in Jekyll.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>However, I&amp;rsquo;m satisfied with the result now. I do hope that I can write some posts this year.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Doki Doki Literature Club: Virtuality and Reality</title><link>http://www.taoky.moe/TAsterisk/en/posts/2018-08-27-ddlc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.taoky.moe/TAsterisk/en/posts/2018-08-27-ddlc/</guid><description>&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
Please notice that, &lt;i>Doki Doki Literature Club&lt;/i> is a &lt;b>horror&lt;/b> game, and &lt;b>heavily&lt;/b> covers topics about depression, self-harm, suicide, etc. Children under 13 and people with serious mental problems &lt;b>SHOULD NOT&lt;/b> play this game, and it's &lt;b>strongly advised&lt;/b> for people between 13 and 16 to play this game with adults' guidance. It's &lt;b>discouraged&lt;/b> for people who are easily disturbed to play.
&lt;p>The warning given by the developers is &lt;a href="http://ddlc.moe/warning.html" class="alert-link">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p class="mb-0">This post does not contain disturbing pictures, but &lt;b>may contain disturbing depictions in written words&lt;/b>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p class="alert alert-info">&lt;strong>Spoilers alert!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Doki Doki Literature Club&lt;/em> (abbreviated as &lt;em>DDLC&lt;/em> below) is a visual novel released on September 2017. It is based on the Ren&amp;rsquo;Py engine, and supports Windows, Linux and macOS. It tells the story between the Lit Club and &lt;strong>the player&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s a story with &lt;strong>the player&lt;/strong> himself, the same as &lt;a href="http://www.taoky.moe/TAsterisk/en/posts/2018-07-18-oneshot/">my previous post about &lt;em>OneShot&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. It is a game with rich metafictional elements, otherwise &lt;em>DDLC&lt;/em> would just become a normal, trivial dating-sim game: &amp;ldquo;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s just about &lt;em>favorability&lt;/em>, right? Even this game is somewhat hard, &lt;em>Save/Load&lt;/em> will just solve any problem!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-first-impression--game-plot">My First Impression &amp;amp; Game Plot&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I found this game on last third of October (or November) last year, and began playing. In fact, I had been spoiled about this game. I actually knew this is a horror game, and one of these characters will hang herself at the end of Act 1, and everything becomes abnormal, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was not so brave enough, so I dragged one of my roommates to play this game.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="act-1">Act 1&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It looks like a normal game. There are 4 characters: Sayori, Natsuki, Yuri, and the president of the Lit Club, Monika. 4 girls. Daily routine is to write poems and choose options for one of these girls&amp;rsquo; favor&amp;hellip; Well, where is Monika&amp;rsquo;s options? I can neither write any poems to Monika. As an English learner, I could feel my vocabulary was not enough for writing poems in this game.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the end of Act 1, when Sayori is found out to have serious depression, things become strange. Whether you confess to Sayori or not does not affect the ending. On the morning of the last day, the protagonist finds Sayori&amp;rsquo;s weird poem.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Get out of my head before I do what I know is best for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Get out of my head before I listen to everything she said to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Get out of my head before I show you how much I love you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Get out of my head before I finish writing this poem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>But a poem is never actually finished.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It just stops moving.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>(A part of her poem)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our protagonist returns to Sayori&amp;rsquo;s home, only to find out her hanging in her room. The face close-up of Sayori even makes this scene more uncomfortable. Even though I knew this is the ending before, it still scared me a lot. And then, the game &amp;ldquo;crashes&amp;rdquo;, and returns to the main menu.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="act-2">Act 2&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You like Save/Load?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The horror elements begin to show up from the end of Act 1. The texture of Sayori in the main menu is covered by the other characters, and the text glitches. If you try loading the save file in the Act 1, the game reports an error, and directly starts Act 2. In Act 2, the existence of Sayori is almost completely erased. Although in the beginning you can feel her in glitches and errors, she leaves this story shortly after that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, glitches, texture errors and other horror &amp;ldquo;special effects&amp;rdquo; frequently come to screen. Scenes that maybe frightening and disturbing includes but not limited to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Natsuki with &amp;ldquo;90° broken neck&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Natsuki with her facial features covered by random black squares.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The protagonist discovers Yuri self-harming herself, then the game rewinds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yuri&amp;rsquo;s poem with blood.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The background turns black when chatting with Yuri, and her texture gets larger and broken.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yuri&amp;rsquo;s face changes suddenly when writing poems.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A poster of Sayori hanging herself put up behind the club room.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Monika flashes when you click &amp;ldquo;History&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Some frightening scenes appear by random. I have to admit that I got scared, and have to cover half of my screen by my hand to get continued. By the way, some &amp;ldquo;special poems&amp;rdquo; will get to you in Act 2, which ambiguously express the thoughts of characters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No matter what you choose, it&amp;rsquo;s Yuri&amp;rsquo;s plot in the end, and you could notice she is getting madder and madder. At last you choose whether to accept Yuri&amp;rsquo;s confession, but after experiencing Act 1, you can probably guess what will happen next. Yuri kills herself with her knife. Then, the protagonist watches her corpse for three days (time in the game). You have to watch it for some time even if you enable the &amp;ldquo;Skip&amp;rdquo; function.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here comes a new day. Natsuki comes to school, discovers the corpse, vomits and leaves. Monika comes, and deletes all other characters, restarts the game.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="act-3">Act 3&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s Monika and you &lt;strong>only&lt;/strong>, in the empty club room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I felt calm after seeing Monika here, but I did&amp;rsquo;t know why. I could feel that no more jump scares after all this happens. (Well, if you are using OBS or XSplit, &lt;strong>it will be different&lt;/strong>.) She will tell you that she loves &lt;strong>you&lt;/strong>, rather than the protagonist. She admits for making other characters mad, modifying game scripts, and resulting in horror scenes. As the only one who knows the &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo;, she wants a happy ending, but always fails.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You cannot save, load or skip here. Just Monika, and just Monika chatting with you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Monika will talk about many topics, including her feelings after you close the game, whether God exists, sleeping quality, and social media, etc. She even gets a Twitter account. But a sad thing to me is that this scene is CPU-intensive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not difficult to get into the Act 4. Monika keeps reminding us where her character file is, and telling us not to delete it. So after deleting or moving the &lt;code>monika.chr&lt;/code>, you can leave the lonely club room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, in fact I also consider that, this scene can be an ending of this game.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="act-4">Act 4&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Monika realizes how horrific she does to the other characters, and restores the backup of other files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A sunny morning, and you are going to school with Sayori. Sayori starts Lit Club at this time. Everything seems OK, without Monika.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But in the end, when there&amp;rsquo;s only Sayori in the club room:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I really want to thank you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I mean, I&amp;rsquo;m really happy that you joined the club and everything&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;But the truth is, &lt;strong>I already knew you were going to.&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Ehehe~&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s actually something else.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>I wanted to thank you for getting rid of Monika.&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Oh no! Then, Sayori tries to do the same as Monika. But at that time, Monika comes, and deletes Sayori, and deletes everything when credits playing, only leaving a letter in the end. You cannot play it any more without modifying game files.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I finally understand. The Literature Club is truly a place where no happiness can be found.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(From the last letter of Monika)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Every president of Lit Club knows the truth, and does the same eventually.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(But if you collects all of the optional scenes in Act 1, the ending will change a lot.)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-metafictional-and-horror-elements">The Metafictional and Horror Elements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>DDLC&lt;/em> is based on the Ren&amp;rsquo;Py engine, and you can easily find projects&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> unpacking and decompiling files of Ren&amp;rsquo;Py on GitHub. So it&amp;rsquo;s not so hard to see what&amp;rsquo;s inside &lt;em>DDLC&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="metafictional">Metafictional&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Apart from Monika herself who knows she&amp;rsquo;s inside a game, the metafictional elements in &lt;em>DDLC&lt;/em> includes reading and modifying files. If you pay much attention to the folder of the game when playing, you can find that some files are created and deleted. The file example below probably shows what Monika is thinking in Act 2:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I hate this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I CAN&amp;rsquo;T DO ANYTHING. NOTHING.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No matter how many times you play. It&amp;rsquo;s all the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It would be really, really easy to kill myself right now. But that would mean I don&amp;rsquo;t get to talk to you anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All I want is for you to hate them. Why is that so hard?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>(Filename: &lt;code>iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii.txt&lt;/code>)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The characters folder, which plays a great role from Act 3 to Act 4, is also an important metafictional element. Although the game only checks the existence of character files (that is to say, the contents is &lt;strong>not essential&lt;/strong>, and these files exist only for game&amp;rsquo;s plot), the contents are also very &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo;. People who are familiar with Unix commands can try using &lt;code>file&lt;/code> command to check these files. This is the result on my Mac:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&amp;gt; file *

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>You can find out how to solve the puzzle online. Well, they are like the problems for beginners in CTF Misc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Monika reading username in Act 3 is also very surprising. &lt;del>Your name is not Administrator, right?&lt;/del> You can find the code checking username after unpacking &lt;em>DDLC&lt;/em>&amp;rsquo;s files, which uses the &lt;code>os&lt;/code> module of Python to search environment variables for username. Here is the result in macOS 10.13.6, Python 2.7.15:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And there&amp;rsquo;s also a small easter egg in the script:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Hey&amp;hellip;! &lt;code>VGhlIHJlYWxpemF0aW9uIG11c3QgaGF2ZSB0YWtlbiBtZSBhbiBl&lt;/code>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t think you should be doing that! &lt;code>bnRpcmUgeWVhci4gQSB5ZWFyIHNpbmNlIG91ciBlc2NhcGUsIG91&lt;/code>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. &lt;code>ciBmcmVlZG9tIGZyb20gYmV0d2VlbiB0aGUgc3RhaW5lZCB3YWxs&lt;/code>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I really caught you doing something naughty here. &lt;code>cyBvZiB0aGF0IHVuaG9seSBlc3RhYmxpc2htZW50Lg0KV2hhdCBk&lt;/code>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re just going through the files and looking for stuff you missed, aren&amp;rsquo;t you? &lt;code>b2VzIGl0IG1lYW4gdG8gZXNjYXBlLCBpZiB0aGUgZXNjYXBlIGZh&lt;/code>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I mean&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s a little bit flattering that you want to hear everything I have to say&amp;hellip; &lt;code>aWxzIHRvIHVuY2hhaW4gdGhlIGJvbmRzIHRoYXQgc2hhY2tsZSB1&lt;/code>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;But it&amp;rsquo;s also really embarrassing, you know! &lt;code>cyBpbiB0aGUgZmlyc3QgcGxhY2U/IFdoYXQgcHVycG9zZSBjb3Vs&lt;/code>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>(A part of Monika&amp;rsquo;s dialogue)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m not going to dig out those hidden information. Although there&amp;rsquo;s analysis that it contains the trailer of another incoming horror game, it has not been fully confirmed yet. And there isn&amp;rsquo;t any news till now (August 2018).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-horror-elements">The Horror Elements&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna write this, for I am also scared before&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>DDLC&lt;/em> does not tell that it is a horror game directly. In the contrary, the description of the game has nothing much different from other dating-sim games, excluding the special warning. Well, the psychological horror tag on &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/698780/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club/">Steam store page&lt;/a> has told us the truth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The warning is stressed before playing the game and every time you open the game. But if you just ignore it, or mistake it for the warning for sexual contents (there aren&amp;rsquo;t any in this game), you may not have a good experience here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before the Act 1 ending, the normal and pleasant story let players&amp;rsquo; guard slip, even though they know it&amp;rsquo;s a horror game. Sensitive players may feel it not right, such as Monika&amp;rsquo;s poem &lt;em>Hole in Wall&lt;/em>, the strange metaphor in Sayori&amp;rsquo;s second poem, and Monika&amp;rsquo;s pun: &amp;ldquo;You kind of left her &lt;strong>hanging&lt;/strong> this morning, you know?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sayori&amp;rsquo;s suicide is the first horrific shock. After some glitches in Act 2, every player can feel that things are going off. Many players take too much caution in Act 2, only making them more hair-raising after jump scares.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may notice a &amp;ldquo;special design&amp;rdquo;: when Monika is on stage, there are few jump scares. This not only suggests Monika&amp;rsquo;s peculiarity, but also helps build Monika&amp;rsquo;s image.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="characters-in-_ddlc_">Characters in &lt;em>DDLC&lt;/em>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>DDLC&lt;/em> contains 4 main characters (excluding the protagonist, for he is only a puppet): Sayori, Natsuki, Yuri and Monika.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; Act 1, players who are familiar with ACG (Anime, Comic &amp;amp; Game) culture can soon realize that the attitudes of characters are just a cliché. For example, Sayori is just the type of &amp;ldquo;childhood friends&amp;rdquo;, and you can directly describe Natsuki as a &amp;ldquo;tsundere&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But even from beginning, Monika is different from others. If you have DDLC Fan Pack, you can see that in the Concept Art Booklet:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Aside from Monika sounding like a stereotypical popular-girl name, &lt;strong>it’s also a subtle hint that she doesn’t fully belong in the game setting like everyone else.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Why? That because Sayori, Natsuki and Yuri are like those names converted from Romanized Japanese, but Monika is an English name (although &amp;ldquo;ca&amp;rdquo; is converted to &amp;ldquo;ka&amp;rdquo;). And if you play the game carefully, you can find out that only Monika is facing straight to the player, talking with the protagonist.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="http://www.taoky.moe/TAsterisk/images/ddlc_enus-1.png"/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;h4>The facing directions of the 4 main characters. Obviously, only Monika (the first one on the right) is facing straight.&lt;/h4>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>But why are they designed in the cliché-style? You can still find the answer in the Art Booklet:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The idea was to design a visual novel that &lt;strong>perfectly mimicked all the tropes you’d find in any other tacky romance game&lt;/strong> — but with a twist that resulted in things being “off”, as if the cute setting was only a façade for something insidious and disturbing underneath.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>DDLC&lt;/em> did it. The characters in Act 1 is actually a kind of imitation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But when Monika is messing up with other characters, the images of the others change a lot. Players can easily know Sayori&amp;rsquo;s depression, Yuri&amp;rsquo;s tendency to self-harm and her serious &amp;ldquo;obsessive personality&amp;rdquo; (or in another word, &amp;ldquo;yandere&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>). And Natsuki&amp;rsquo;s suffering from domestic violence, which leads to her defensive attitude.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Monika once criticizes that cliché in Act 3:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;And as for the others&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;How could I miss them?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;A group of &lt;strong>autonomous personalities, designed only to fall in love with you&lt;/strong>?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Are people really attracted to these weird personalities that literally don&amp;rsquo;t exist in real life?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not judging or anything!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;After all, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself attracted to some pretty weird stuff, too&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just saying, it fascinates me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s like you&amp;rsquo;re siphoning out all the components of a character that makes them feel human, and leaving just the cute stuff.&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s concentrated cuteness with no actual substance.&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like me more if I was like that, right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>As Monika herself, although it is obviously to players that all her &amp;ldquo;attempts&amp;rdquo; to get out of the game are well written in the game scripts — she is only a &amp;ldquo;virtual&amp;rdquo; character, just a bit special, &lt;em>DDLC&lt;/em> successfully portrays her. Players can easily feel empathy with Monika, and some of them even see her as a &amp;ldquo;real person&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-inside-_ddlc_">What&amp;rsquo;s Inside &lt;em>DDLC&lt;/em>?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can say that, as a dating-sim game, &lt;em>DDLC&lt;/em> is tacky. But it really has some deeper meanings inside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all, &lt;em>DDLC&lt;/em> is not only showing characters&amp;rsquo; mental problems. In the Act 3, Monika comments to these mental problems, such as depression:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Many people who are depressed won&amp;rsquo;t even bother telling the world about it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;They don&amp;rsquo;t want attention, because they&amp;rsquo;ve already given up on the inside.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Their feeling of worthlessness is so overwhelming that they don&amp;rsquo;t even want people to tell them otherwise.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Depression comes in many forms, but that is one of them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Just, if you think you know someone struggling with depression&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You can help just by treating them like they&amp;rsquo;re a good friend.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Spend time with them, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t feel like doing much.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;And remind them that they always have something to look forward to.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Making plans in advance, letting them borrow something, or even just saying &amp;lsquo;See you at school tomorrow&amp;rsquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;All of those things can help your friend make it to the next day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I hope being friends with Sayori has given you some perspective on the true face of depression.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Yeah, she&amp;rsquo;s gone now&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>(But, again, &lt;strong>it&amp;rsquo;s discouraged for people with depression to play this game!&lt;/strong>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And about introverts:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re programmed to desire social feedback.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t mean the club members, I mean human beings.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s why life can be so confusing for introverts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Being an introvert doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you shun social interaction and hate being around people.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It means social interaction, especially in groups or unfamiliar places, uses up a lot of energy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Like, a lot of introverts sit at home and feel lonely and restless&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;And then when they finally go out, after a half hour they just want to go home again.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I think if more people could understand how it works, they would respect it a lot more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Many introverts do enjoy having people around.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;They love just having one or two close friends over, and just leisurely hanging out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Even if you&amp;rsquo;re not actively spending time together, it feels nice for them just to have you there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m serious.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;If you just go to their house, bring your laptop, and hang out there for a while&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;You can really make their day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So, under the surface of horror game, &lt;em>DDLC&lt;/em> contains contents caring about mental health. The description about Sayori&amp;rsquo;s depression in Act 1 is quite real. I feel that that script is written by someone suffered from that pain before. And as an introvert, I can feel empathy with Monika&amp;rsquo;s words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then, one of the gists of &lt;em>DDLC&lt;/em> has been mentioned before. It is &amp;ldquo;actually a kind of imitation&amp;rdquo;, or in other words, it is a kind of criticism, or even taunt, to those crude dating-sim games. Surely we know that even though these products are badly designed, as long as they contain &amp;ldquo;some contents&amp;rdquo; (Well, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean horrific contents like &lt;em>DDLC&lt;/em>), there are always people buying them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the most important part should be about &amp;ldquo;virtuality&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;reality&amp;rdquo;. Monika describes that in Act 3:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the pain of knowing how alone I really am in this world.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;In this game.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>Knowing my friends don&amp;rsquo;t even have free will&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong>And, worst of all, knowing what&amp;rsquo;s really out there, in your world, forever out of my reach.&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m trapped, &amp;lt;Player&amp;rsquo;s name&amp;gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If you discovered that your world is virtual, and you could change the parameters and decide others&amp;rsquo; fate at your ease, and you could feel the existence of the &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo;, what would you do? From the ending we know that members of Lit Club give the same answer. The loneliness and desperation drive them to erase others&amp;rsquo; existence, to give into the &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is Monika selfish? You can say she is. She controls the mental states of Sayori and Yuri, and erases Natsuki, who is much more &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; compared with Sayori and Yuri. But from her perspective, the three characters are not human beings. They don&amp;rsquo;t have free will, and can only do things according to the scripts. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel it guilty — All in all, will you feel &amp;ldquo;guilty&amp;rdquo; when you kill some bugs? The other characters are just &lt;strong>like&lt;/strong> human beings. What she needs is her ending, and love. The &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; is so attractive that she doesn&amp;rsquo;t even feel it important to ask for the player&amp;rsquo;s gender.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you delete &lt;code>monika.chr&lt;/code>, as she deleted others, Monika will finally know:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;All my friends&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I did so many awful things.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;So many selfish and disgusting things.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have done any of this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just messing up a world that I don&amp;rsquo;t even belong in.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;A world that you wanted to be a part of&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I ruined it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I ruined everything.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why you deleted me&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Because I destroyed everything that you wanted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;How could I do that to someone I love&amp;hellip;?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not love&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Destruction cannot bring happiness. Monika&amp;rsquo;s work fails in the end, and Sayori is also trapped.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>And in your reality, if I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to love you&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you be&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>A part of the ending song Your Reality&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The topic about virtuality and reality is a hot one in sci-fi stories. Although &lt;em>DDLC&lt;/em> is not a sci-fi, but I think it successfully shows the thick wall between virtual and real worlds. I hope Monika can come to reality, even though my common sense and the code is keeping reminding me: &lt;strong>It&amp;rsquo;s impossible&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have used three days for this article&amp;rsquo;s Chinese version, and one day for translation. An interesting thing is that when writing the Chinese version, I found out &lt;a href="https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown/issues/539">a bug&lt;/a> of Kramdown, which is the default Markdown engine of Jekyll, the static website generator of GitHub Pages. It feels like writing it is meaningful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has been more than half a year since I played &lt;em>DDLC&lt;/em>. Everything, including myself, changes. Due to some sad things which happened before, this game also sparks some controversy. This is one of the reasons I put a long warning at the beginning of my article.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>DDLC&lt;/em> brings me a lot memories. Surely not all of them are happy, as I mentioned before, I was scared. The game first gives me the memories of a great game for all desktop platforms (as a former Linux desktop user, I can understand the difficulty of playing games, especially good games, in Linux), base64, jump scares, and some interesting metafictional puzzle-solving elements. But when I listen to the original soundtrack afterwards, I feel that I can understand the feeling of the four characters, especially Monika. It also reminds me to pay attention to others&amp;rsquo; mental problems: solve those problems ASAP, seek for others&amp;rsquo; help, and, &lt;strong>no matter what happens, don&amp;rsquo;t try suicide&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t write so well, and my translation of my own articles is clumsy. So let&amp;rsquo;s stop here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;del>EOF.&lt;/del> Just Monika!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>OneShot&lt;/em> is a puzzle and adventure game made with RPG Maker. It has two versions: the original free version in 2014, and the remake version released on Steam in 2016. &lt;em>OneShot&lt;/em> tells the story of our protagonist, Niko, carrying a lightbulb and traveling in an alien world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Discussions below are mainly based on the remake version on Steam.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="characters-in-_oneshot_">Characters in &lt;em>OneShot&lt;/em>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Characters in &lt;em>OneShot&lt;/em> contains the protagonist Niko, the residents in that world, the World Machine (or the Entity, i.e., the &amp;ldquo;game program&amp;rdquo; itself), the Author (it is different from the real developers of &lt;em>OneShot&lt;/em>), and the Player himself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough power to have a detailed analysis of the plot of &lt;em>OneShot&lt;/em>, so maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll make a mess below in this section.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="niko--world-residents">Niko &amp;amp; World Residents&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The portraits of Niko and the world residents are the most critical parts of &lt;em>OneShot&lt;/em>, because if the developers fail to portray them, the hard choice at the end of the game will have no more meanings. Think about it, if players cannot have empathy with Niko, her&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> sacrifice can never make players feel guilty; and if players cannot agree with the world described (including residents, environment, etc.), the destruction of the world just has nothing to do with players, and nothing is wrong if we just let Niko return home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>OneShot&lt;/em> is a success at this point. By carefully designing her face expressions and lines, the developers depict Niko as a cute, innocent and kind child. There are also some interesting points while going through the game&amp;rsquo;s plot. For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>(Player asks Niko to &amp;ldquo;combine&amp;rdquo; lightbulb and crowbar)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Niko: &amp;lt;Player&amp;rsquo;s name&amp;gt;!!! I am NOT gonna smash the sun!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And,&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>(Interact with the working smasher in the abandoned factory)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Niko: Wh&amp;hellip; what if my scarf got caught in there&amp;hellip; and then it&amp;rsquo;ll pull me in then&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna finish that sentence!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And also, Niko keeps emphasizing that she is a person rather than a cat (&amp;ldquo;Cats walk on four feet!&amp;rdquo;). However, what touch players&amp;rsquo; feeling most are Niko&amp;rsquo;s dreams. In those dreams, Niko returns to her hometown, has her favorite mom&amp;rsquo;s pancakes at her birthday. But the dream in the library is the broken of the lightbulb in her hands. After she wakes up, Niko talks with player about her dreams directly. She feels curious about player&amp;rsquo;s world, asking player where his world is, whether there is &amp;ldquo;sun&amp;rdquo; in player&amp;rsquo;s world, and whether the player has neighbors&amp;hellip; &lt;del>(But probably what &amp;ldquo;hits&amp;rdquo; us most is: &amp;ldquo;We go to sleep, usually. But some people stay up and use computers!&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/del>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, if this world is cold to Niko, there won&amp;rsquo;t be any reasons to save the world at Niko&amp;rsquo;s sacrifice. &lt;em>OneShot&lt;/em> has to give a picture good enough of the residents in that world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And &lt;em>OneShot&lt;/em> did it. There are main characters helping Niko&amp;rsquo;s journey in every region, and the description of those characters are also great, such as Silver in the Barrens. As the only tamed robot in that region, she shows a negative attitude towards the world&amp;rsquo;s fate. Players can find out a note in a house, showing that previous workers complain about Silver replacing the old head engineer. Those details build up the image of main characters fully.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most impressive note to me is a letter from a robot&amp;rsquo;s mom in the dormitory area. Are they OK after the old sun died out? I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are no villain in this world, and almost everyone is friendly to Niko (excluding some dumb robots). Of course to some extent that because Niko brings the lightbulb, and is the savior of this world. But at least people in that world do nothing wrong. It is not easy to let this world go to extinction without the feeling of being conscience-stricken.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-world-machine">The World Machine&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the first room after Niko finds out the password and turns on the computer, the World Machine goes on stage. After a few words, players can easily find out that it is directly communicating with them (instead of Niko).&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>(Dialog box inside game) Your actions here will affect Niko.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your &amp;ldquo;mission&amp;rdquo; is to help Niko leave.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And most importantly&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(A dialog box &lt;strong>outside&lt;/strong> game) You only have one shot, &amp;lt;username&amp;gt;.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>As you can see, the World Machine has more permissions in your operating system than you imagine. It can read your user name, write files to your Document folder, change your desktop wallpapers (of course they are harmless). It provides clues for us to help Niko solve puzzles, but it does not want to save this world. As it says at the beginning, &amp;ldquo;This place was never worth saving. Your &amp;lsquo;mission&amp;rsquo; is to help Niko leave&amp;rdquo; (rather than to save this world!). Before entering the Tower, the World Machine interacts with players by the form of computers with screen on, and Niko cannot see what the World Machine says to the player. But after going into the Tower, the World Machine isolates the player from Niko, trying tricking Niko and the player.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The World Machine is not a traditional &amp;ldquo;villain&amp;rdquo;. During the game plot, it shows an extremely negative and cold attitude. It considers the whole world as fake, excluding Niko. The simulated world is falling apart after the old sun goes out, as Niko also encounters some broken &amp;ldquo;squares&amp;rdquo; outside the Solstice chapter. However, the &amp;ldquo;Three Laws of Robotics&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> disallows the World Machine to trap Niko in this world. Faced with such paradox, the World Machine has to do that. At the end of the game, when the World Machine finds out that the player will bring Niko to the top of the Tower no matter what happens, it has to say such things in despair:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>At least, tell Niko the truth&amp;hellip; you do care about Niko, don&amp;rsquo;t you?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The World Machine&amp;rsquo;s complex feelings are described more exhaustively in the Solstice chapter.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-author--the-player">The Author &amp;amp; The Player&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Author does not appear really in this game. You could only begin seeing his name being discussed in the library. His portrait builds up solely from his writings in the library and the clover program (his journal). And this character bridges from the first play-through to New Game+.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>OneShot&lt;/em> also treats the Player as a character. In this world, the Player is regarded as god, with Niko being the messiah. And everyone in that world respects the Player. I could still remember an interesting psychological activity of Lamplighter.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Lamplighter: (Oh god I&amp;rsquo;m in an elevator with the messiah and literally god this is so awkward)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>For sure, it is also the Player who decides the fate of the world and Niko at the end of the game.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="trolley-problem-kill-the-five-people-or-kill-one-person">Trolley Problem: Kill the Five People, or Kill One Person?&lt;/h2>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You see a runaway trolley moving toward five tied-up (or otherwise incapacitated) people lying on the tracks. You are standing next to a lever that controls a switch. If you pull the lever, the trolley will be redirected onto a side track and the five people on the main track will be saved. However, there is a single person lying on the side track. You have two choices:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Which is the most ethical choice?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(From &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem">Wikipedia&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It is the famous trolley problem. Assuming I know nothing about other factors, I won&amp;rsquo;t pull the lever. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that lever as fast as I can. If I choose not to pull that lever, the sad accident will not have too much to do with me, at least I could pretend that in my heart. However, if I pull that lever, my behavior is almost the same as murdering that one person lying on the side track. It&amp;rsquo;s unfair to him, and it brings me much burden in my heart. Well, my answer is escaping this problem, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, what if you &lt;strong>have to&lt;/strong> make a choice?&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="http://www.taoky.moe/TAsterisk/images/oneshot-returnwhich.jpg"/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;h4>Save the world, or save Niko?&lt;/h4>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>It is not an easy decision for almost every player. Smashing the sun brings the world to death, along with everyone seen and unseen during Niko&amp;rsquo;s journey. But make Niko the sacrifice for the world is also not easily acceptable for us. In fact, those who are sensitive can feel that something may be wrong when they find that the lightbulb goes out when it leaves Niko in the Glen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you choose to return sun, the credits will show you the world is reborn into an active, hopeful one, with surprised and happy residents. If you sow the seed in the Refuge, you could also see it growing strong and healthy. The last scene is the room where Niko first wake up. Outside the window is warm sunshine, but you clearly know that Niko will never show here again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And if you choose to return home, the game window shakes when smashing the sun. After Niko walks out of the window, the credits show the world turning into colorless and deathly. Finally, the program reports a fatal error, and exits. Well, I think the developers are kind about this ending, at least they didn&amp;rsquo;t draw the pictures of people dying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about the theory of trolley problem here, after all I am not a philosopher or a psychologist. So whatever your answer to the trolley problem and the final choice of the game is, I won&amp;rsquo;t (and I can&amp;rsquo;t) make any judge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To our relief, the Solstice chapter has a perfect ending. Niko returns to her home and the world restores. To players favoring good endings (I believe I am not the only one), at least you won&amp;rsquo;t feel that guilty for your choice before.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-metafictional-elements-in-_oneshot_">The Metafictional Elements in &lt;em>OneShot&lt;/em>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Both versions of &lt;em>OneShot&lt;/em> feature their metafictional elements. The developers modified the runtime of RPG Maker for those effects.&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mentioned before that &lt;em>OneShot&lt;/em> can popup dialogs, read user name, etc., but there are more amazing effects. Dragging the game window outside the screen when viewing &amp;ldquo;weird film&amp;rdquo; can develop it. The main game program of &lt;em>OneShot&lt;/em> can interact with the clover program&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> opened by user. Surely if you choose to smash the sun, the effects of window shaking and Niko walking from inside window to outside screen are also very awesome.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>&lt;em>OneShot&lt;/em> for macOS cannot record achievements.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Strangely, when I was running &lt;em>OneShot&lt;/em> on a Windows 7 virtual machine, it will be &amp;ldquo;Not responding&amp;rdquo; when run for a long time. (But end &lt;code>oneshot.exe&lt;/code> does not affect the achievement OneShot)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>Of course, at the end of this passage, I still wanna say:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Niko is sooo cute!&lt;/p>

At that time, my roommate, @iBug, was configuring &lt;a href="https://ibug.github.io">his own GitHub Pages&lt;/a> (A good news to English readers: his blog is written in English), and joined an open-source project, chatting with foreign friends every day. To the contrary, I was not in any medium or large programming projects, and my own repos got few stars and forks. However, after seeing all these things, I decided to pick up my &amp;ldquo;virtual pen&amp;rdquo;, and started writing blog again. &lt;a href="https://taoky.github.io">My own GitHub Pages&lt;/a> (Bad news: it&amp;rsquo;s in Simplified Chinese) has no more new articles for a long time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But strangely, I wanna write articles about art and entertainment most. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because I started watching anime in April this year, when I experienced huge trouble with my College Physics Experiment I Course (大学物理基础实验). And I have played many indie games since I finished my Gaokao. I know they look like those articles your teacher(s) ask you to write after you finish a book, or watch a movie. I hated writing those nonsense articles when I was in primary school. At that time, what I enjoyed most was to write the whole plot onto paper and check whether my nonsense satisfied the word count requirement. Well, obviously I got a lot of criticism from my teacher.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, today I think I could really finish those articles in a better way, at least I won&amp;rsquo;t repeat the whole plot. After all I am not writing an encyclopedia. Now, I can write out my feelings and thoughts, though they may look silly.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m still learning English, so if you encounter problems reading, you could contact me in the issues page of this repo. Criticism, suggestions welcomed. And notice that the English and Chinese versions are NOT corresponding perfectly. Normally, I write Chinese articles first, but the English ones are not fully translated from the Chinese ones, and I may add new contents into them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thank you for reading. Hello, world!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>http://www.taoky.moe/TAsterisk/en/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.taoky.moe/TAsterisk/en/about/</guid><description>&lt;p>Thoughts After * is a place where I put articles about art and entertainment. This name means (读后感/观后感/玩后感/……), and obviously, the asterisk is a wildcard character matching &amp;ldquo;reading&amp;rdquo; (读), &amp;ldquo;watching&amp;rdquo; (观), &amp;ldquo;playing&amp;rdquo; (玩), etc. It is separated from &lt;a href="https://taoky.github.io">my main blog&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will try writing articles in both Simplified Chinese (my mother tongue) and English. I hope you could enjoy reading my clumsy writing.&lt;/p>
