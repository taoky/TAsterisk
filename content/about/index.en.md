Thoughts After * is a place where I put articles about art and entertainment. This name means (读后感/观后感/玩后感/……), and obviously, the asterisk is a wildcard character matching "reading" (读), "watching" (观), "playing" (玩), etc. It is separated from [my main blog](https://taoky.github.io).

I will try writing articles in both Simplified Chinese (my mother tongue) and English. I hope you could enjoy reading my clumsy writing.
