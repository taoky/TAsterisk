Well, when I was preparing for my final exams the other day, I came up with an idea. At that time, my roommate, @iBug, was configuring [his own GitHub Pages](https://ibug.github.io) (A good news to English readers: his blog is written in English), and joined an open-source project, chatting with foreign friends every day. To the contrary, I was not in any medium or large programming projects, and my own repos got few stars and forks. However, after seeing all these things, I decided to pick up my "virtual pen", and started writing blog again. [My own GitHub Pages](https://taoky.github.io) (Bad news: it's in Simplified Chinese) has no more new articles for a long time.

But strangely, I wanna write articles about art and entertainment most. Maybe it's because I started watching anime in April this year, when I experienced huge trouble with my College Physics Experiment I Course (大学物理基础实验). And I have played many indie games since I finished my Gaokao. I know they look like those articles your teacher(s) ask you to write after you finish a book, or watch a movie. I hated writing those nonsense articles when I was in primary school. At that time, what I enjoyed most was to write the whole plot onto paper and check whether my nonsense satisfied the word count requirement. Well, obviously I got a lot of criticism from my teacher.

However, today I think I could really finish those articles in a better way, at least I won't repeat the whole plot. After all I am not writing an encyclopedia. Now, I can write out my feelings and thoughts, though they may look silly.

I'm still learning English, so if you encounter problems reading, you could contact me in the issues page of this repo. Criticism, suggestions welcomed. And notice that the English and Chinese versions are NOT corresponding perfectly. Normally, I write Chinese articles first, but the English ones are not fully translated from the Chinese ones, and I may add new contents into them.

Thank you for reading. Hello, world!
