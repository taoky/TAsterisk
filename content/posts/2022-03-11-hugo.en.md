As I don't have too many things to do recently, I have just migrated TAsterisk from Jekyll to Hugo, with the default theme in Hugo Quickstart docs.

Pros:

- It's FAST (fewer than 10 seconds in GitHub Actions to build!)
- Great multilanguage support, without writing any weird template or JavaScript in Jekyll.

Cons:

- I cannot customize my theme conveniently as in Jekyll.

However, I'm satisfied with the result now. I do hope that I can write some posts this year.
